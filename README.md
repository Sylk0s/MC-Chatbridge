# MC-Chatbridge

Basic Discord intergration for MC that can run on a vanilla server. Simply compile the code and place the jar file in the same directory as the mc server. To run the server, do java -jar [INSTER JAR NAME HERE] java -jar Server.jar -nogui. It will generate a configs file for some bot info. Look at configs.json for more info.

Future plans: 
1) Make the whole project more user friendly
2) Send messages to a web server and then have the discord bot grab them from there. This way, the bot can run on a seperate machine.
